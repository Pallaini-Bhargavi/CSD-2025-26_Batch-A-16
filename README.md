# Dynamic Energy Trading with Blockchain

This project implements a blockchain-based P2P energy trading system where prosumers trade surplus energy directly. It uses a supplyâ€“demand ratio (SDR) dynamic pricing model with smart contracts to automate transactions.

The system is simulation-based, evaluating price convergence, reduced grid dependency, and prosumer benefits, ensuring secure, transparent, and efficient energy trading for sustainable communities.

## Key Features:

1. Secure and decentralized energy trading using blockchain.

2. SDR-based dynamic pricing model for fair settlements.

3. Smart contracts for automated transaction execution.

4. Simulation-based testing and analysis of system performance.

5. Potential for scalable deployment in local energy networks.

## Technologies Used:

Blockchain: Ethereum

Smart Contracts: Solidity

Backend: Python (Flask/Django)

Frontend: React / Next.js

Simulation Tools: Custom SDR-based energy trading simulator
